## 💡 Core Concepts

- 🧬 **Inheritance** — Allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and hierarchy modeling.  
- 🔁 **Method Overriding** — Enables a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.  
- 🧩 **Polymorphism** — Supports the use of a single interface to represent different underlying data types, allowing flexible code execution.  
- 🔍 **instanceof Operator** — Determines whether an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass.  
- 🧠 **getClass()** — Retrieves the runtime class of an object for type-checking and reflection purposes.  
- 📝 **@Override Annotation** — Signals that a method is overriding a superclass method, improving code clarity and correctness.  
- 📦 **Abstract Classes** — Provides a partially implemented class meant to be extended by subclasses with concrete behavior.  
- 🔧 **Abstract Methods** — Declares methods without implementation, forcing subclasses to provide concrete definitions.
